# LFF JSON Editor

The ultra small JSON and Plist editor.


There's a JSON editor embedded in Lifofinn code editor years, that allows user fast and visually edit JSON file or text block with tree representation, but unfortunately, many people don't know it and people must install LFF(Lifofinn) first then can use the functions of the editor. So, here, separate the editor as a standalone app with very concise UI to help people efficiently edit JSON files.


* validate JSON file or plain text block with accurate error line report.
* construct an empty JSON or Plist tree and visually add child nodes.
* import JSON file or Plist file (binary property list file also supported).
* export as JSON file or Plist file (also can be used to convert between the two file types).
* visually add, duplicate, update, copy, paste, and delete arbitrary node and its children.
* use as a JSON formatter.
* supports big files.
* customise data types with different colour and indicators.
* re-arrange the position of the children of a selected node by drag and drop.
* flexible searching with different scopes and fast iterate in searched result.
* search value or key with Perl regular expression.
* copy the selected node and its children to system pasteboard and paste in TextEdit.app and others.


Scriptable App
===============
The main functions of the app can be called from scripting languages. As a fully programmable app, cooperate with any other scripts and act as a component of complex tasks, e.g, searching records in JSON file with powerful Perl regular expression and other conditions, remove, add, update searched records, and construct a new JSON text block programmingly, etc.
